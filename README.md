# ResBot
ResBot is planned to become a Discord bot that allows you to play The Resistance (with or without the Avalon ruleset) with your friends on your own Discord server.

This project is currently incomplete. You may see occasional commits to this project as I find time to make updates to it. Feel free to fork this repo at any revision and finish it at your own pace.

To implement your own instance of this bot, you will need to change the `TOKEN` and `ADMIN_ID` variables in `resbot.py` to your own bot's Token (refer to [Discord bot documentation and API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) for more info) and your own Discord user ID (Settings > Appearance > Advanced, enable Developer Mode, then right click your name and select Copy ID)
