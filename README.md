# ResBot
ResBot is a Discord bot that allows you to play The Resistance (with or without the Avalon ruleset) with your friends on your own Discord server.

To implement your own instance of this bot, please make sure to change the `TOKEN` and `ADMIN_ID` variables to your own bot's Token (refer to [Discord bot documentation and API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro) for more info) and your own Discord user ID (Settings > Appearance > Advanced, enable Developer Mode, then right click your name and select Copy ID)

This project is currently incomplete. If you are interested in continuing it, please feel free to fork this repo and let me know if you have any questions.
